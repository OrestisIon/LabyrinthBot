/**
 * In this exercise I made the choice to create a tree and store each Junction as a node of the tree.
 * Each node of the tree has the ability to have three children nodes. One child for east, one child for south and one
 * child for west. The first junction that is met it will be stored as a junction with null parent. Then the next junction
 * will be a child of the current junction. The type of child is decided from the leave property of the current junction
 * which shows what was the heading of the robot when it left the junction. So the child junction created will become
 * current junction with parent as the previous junction.
 *
 * If a junction leads to  dead-ends only then the robot will delete the current junction by setting it to null and
 * set its parent junction as the current junction , in order to explore other paths of the parent junction or leave from the
 * parent junction too if it leads to only dead-ends as well.
 *
 * That way when the robot reaches the target for the first time , there is a tree created, that is the path of the robot
 * to reach the target. Each node of the tree has exactly one child that leads to another node that will eventually lead to
 * the target without getting into any dead ends.
 *
 * In order for the robot to be able to find the first junction of the tree we also store the first heading that of the robot.
 * Because if the robot is not at a junction initially and instead it's at a corridor, when it runs for the second time it
 * won't know what direction to take in order to reach the first junction(node of the tree).
 * The next step in the implementation of this exercise is to think a way for the robot to work in loopy mazes too.
 * Having loops in the junction tree will cause many problems, thus I decided to change the record junction and make it so
 * it returns a Boolean value(true when the robot has just done a loop, or false if it has not done a loop). If the robot has
 * just done a loop then it doesn't record that junction again and backs to the last recorded junction.
 * Like that the we will have only planning trees without any cycles created.
 *
 * I specially chose to create a tree structure because it represents exactly the map that the movement of the robot creates.
 * Maybe I could have used a stack or two dimensional arrays but creating those wouldn't really be as representative as the tree
 * structure is. By creating the exact representation of the robotâ€™s movement then I can more easily adapt the code into new
 * requirements that the customer may have.
 *
 * Testing: Testing is important in this exercise because not only of the length of the code but also because of the increased
 * number of properties that each junction has. Testing the code helped me find scenarios that my robot will not work
 * and will get stuck and modify the existing cod in order to work in every possible situation. One of those situations was
 * when the target is behind the robot in a dead-end and the first move of the robot is outside the dead end. My program
 * initially did not have anything to address that. When it backtracked into the first junction it just got stacked and couldn't
 * move any further. So, I added a method that returns -1 if it's not the first junction and it returns the reverse
 * of the first heading of the robot if it's the first junction that it backtracks to. That heading is also stored as the
 * heading of the robot, since there is no way of going into the first junction again since that leads to dead ends only.
 * So in the second run it will immediately reach the target with just the first heading.
 *
 * Last words: This algorithm works perfectly in a prim generated Junction, as in this kind of mazes the only path that leads to
 * the target is also the quickest. Also the it works fairly good on the hill generator too.When it comes to loopy mazes though,
 * even though the robot successfully finds the target faster than the first time, the difference is not great. This is because in loopy mazes
 * there are many ways for the robot to reach the target and some paths are longer than other paths. A possible solution for that problem
 * is for the robot explore all the maze before reaching the target and then in the second time to calculate and follow the shortest path of
 * all the paths. Lastly on blank mazes even tho the robot finds an optimal path in comparison with the first run, it is
 * not very noticable that the second time goes faster, because in a blanc maze there aren't any dead-ends for the robot to directly
 * back up and know to not take again that direction that leads to the dead-end
